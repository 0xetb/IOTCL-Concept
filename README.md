# IOTCL-Concept
proof of concept IOTCL driver, is not ready for game use, and has no usermode.


I oringally saw a valorant developer use this type of driver, and it interested me so i deicded to develop one myself, this will need a usermode and some development. but with some kernel understanding you should be able to get it working.
